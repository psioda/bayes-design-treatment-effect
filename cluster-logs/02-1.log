3          Program Creator: Matthew Psioda;
4          
5          This SAS program can be run to construct discrete approximations to the sampling priors used in the paper.
6          
7          The program first uses the %COLLAPSE macro to collapse the subject-level e1684 dataset to a dataset of
8          sufficient statistics. The model fitting SAS macros (%FIT_MCMC and %FIT_APPROX) expect this format. This
9          data reduction allows the model to be fit using PROC GENMOD using the connection between PH regression
10         and Poisson regression.
11         
12         Using the reduced historical dataset, the %FIT_MCMC macro is repeatedly called and the results are
13         post-processed. This sas program includes the macro definition for the %EST_SAMP_PRIOR macro. The
14         %EST_SAMP_PRIOR is nothing more than a wrapper to the %FIT_MCMC macro that does some post-processing
15         of the results.
16         
2                                                          The SAS System                             19:48 Tuesday, January 9, 2018

17         This program generates the discrete approximations for the default, truncated, and point mass
18         sampling priors that were used in the paper. The macro calls that generate the discrete approximations
19         begin just after the macro definition for the %EST_SAMP_PRIOR.
20         
21         This program reads in the raw data from the folder &root./data/raw_data (RAW SAS library)
22         and writes out the sampling prior datasets to the folder &root./data/sampling_priors (RES SAS library);
23         
24         The program reads in the %COLLAPSE and %FIT_MCMC macros from the folder &root./macros;
