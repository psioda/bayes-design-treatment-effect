5          This SAS program generates the second stage simulation settings that were explored in the SDD example
6          based on the e1684 dataset that is presented in the paper. Using the stage one results that are stored
7          in the folder &root./data/simulation_results/calibrate_a0 (RESULTS SAS library), this program
8          first identifies the optimal value of a0 for each sample size considered in stage one subject to the
9          specified Bayesian type I error control requirements. To do this, LOESS methods are used to smooth
10         the results and to interpolate the ideal value of a0 for each target number of events. A dataset
11         containing these results is written to the folder &root./data/simulation_results/calibrate_a0
12         (RESULTS SAS library) and is named results.selected_a0. The variables included in this dataset
13         are named nsp, shareBLH, nuTarget, T1Erate, alpha_targ, and a0 (see below for definitions).
14         
15         Using these results, the program then creates a dataset of simulation settings to be explored in
16         the second stage of the SSD procedure (named controls.simulation_controls_alt). The SAS dataset of

17         simulation settings is written to the location: &root./data/simulation_controls (CONTROLS SAS
18         library). The dataset contains the following variables:
19         [ 1] category       – description of null sampling prior used for simulation setting;
20         [ 2] nsp            - name of the dataset that stores the null sampling prior results for the given simulation setting;
21         [ 3] asp            - name of the dataset that stores the alternative sampling prior results for the given simulation
21       ! setting;
22         [ 4] shareBLH       – indicator variable for whether or not all parameters are shared between model (must be
23                               zero in current software);
24         [ 5] nuTarget       – desired number of events in the simulated new trials;
25         [ 6] T1Erate        – estimated Bayesian type I error rate associated with number of events and null sampling prior
26         [ 7] alpha_targg    – targeted Bayesian type I error rate
27         [ 8] a0             – value of a0 to use for power prior
28         [ 9] node_idx       – Integer value that identifies the compute node to be used for a given set of simulations;
29         [10] nPerLoop       – number of datasets to simulate in a given loop cycle – this number cannot be too large due to
30                               system resources. A value of 500 is used in the current setup. The more datasets that are simulated

31                               once, the more memory or disk space needs to be available to SAS to process them;
32         [11] inner_idx      – observation counter for simulation settings to be performed by a given compute node;
33         [12] seed           – random number seed for new trial data generation;
34         [13] parmSampleSeed – random number seed for drawing samples from discrete approximation to the
