6          This SAS program processes the results from the second stage of the simulation
7          process to identify the optimal design for the set of null and alternative
8          sampling priors considered.To do this, LOESS methods are used to smooth
9          the results and to interpolate the ideal values for the target number of events
10         and for the value of a0.
11         
12         The optimal design parameters are written to the location
13         &root./data/simulation_results/calculate_power (RESULTS SAS library);  The dataset created
14         is named results.calculated_power. The dataset contains the following variables:
15         
16         [ 1] category   – description of null sampling prior used for simulation setting;

17         [ 2] alpha_targ – targeted Bayesian type I error rate;
18         [ 3] nsp        - name of the dataset that stores the null sampling prior results for the given simulation setting;
19         [ 4] asp        - name of the dataset that stores the alternative sampling prior results for the given simulation setting
19       ! ;
20         [ 5] shareBLH   – indicator variable for whether or not all parameters are shared between model (must be
21                           zero in current software);
22         [ 6] nuTarget   – desired number of events in the simulated new trials;
23         [ 7] a0         – value of a0 to use for power prior;
24         [ 8] power      - estimated bayesian power;
